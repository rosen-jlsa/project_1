# Salon Booking App (Project 1)

A professional, high-performance booking management system built for high-end hair salons.

## Project Overview

This application provides a seamless experience for clients to explore salon services, view transformations in a gallery, and book appointments with experts. It features a dual-mode data system (Supabase or Local JSON) for maximum reliability during development and production.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Booking Wizard**: Intelligent slot selection within business hours (10:00 - 18:00).
- **Interactive Gallery**: "Before & After" photo transformations.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure management of bookings and specialists.
- **Automated Workflow**: Email notifications and token-based booking approvals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: 18.x or higher
- **Directory**: All commands should be run from within the `project_1/` folder.

### Setup & Run
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project_1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`).
4. Launch development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Launch Readiness

To ensure the project is ready for production, follow the Launch Checklist:

### 1. Verification Script
We have included a specialized script that automatically checks linting and build health. Run this before every deployment:
```powershell
./verify-launch.ps1
```

### 2. GitHub Synchronization
Ensure the latest stable version is on GitHub using the "Full Launch Fix" naming convention.

### 3. Environment Variables
Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correctly set in your production environment.

## Understanding the Project Structure

### What is the `node_modules` folder?
Think of the `node_modules` folder as a **toolbox**. When you build a house, you don't make your own hammer, nails, or saws from scratch; you buy them from a store. In programming, instead of writing every single piece of code (like how to talk to a database or how to show a map), we use "libraries" written by others.
- The `node_modules` folder stores all these external tools.
- It is created when you run `npm install`.
- It is necessary for the app to run and "connect" the frontend to the backend services (like Supabase).

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion
- **Database**: Supabase (with Local Mock fallback)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Maps**: React Leaflet
