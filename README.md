# Salon Booking App (Project 1)

A professional, high-performance booking management system built for high-end hair salons.

## Project Overview

This application provides a seamless experience for clients to explore salon services, view transformations in a gallery, and book appointments with experts. It features a dual-mode data system (Supabase or Local JSON) for maximum reliability during development and production.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Booking Wizard**: Intelligent slot selection within business hours (10:00 - 18:00).
- **Interactive Gallery**: "Before & After" photo transformations.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure management of bookings and specialists.
- **Automated Workflow**: Email notifications and token-based booking approvals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: 18.x or higher
- **Directory**: All commands should be run from within the `project_1/` folder.

### Setup & Run
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project_1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *Note: This creates the `node_modules` folder, which acts as a "toolbox" containing all the external libraries the app needs to function and connect to the backend.*

   **What is the `node_modules` folder?**
   Think of `node_modules` as a **Toolbox**. Inside are all the "tools" (libraries) that other smart people wrote. For example, there is a tool called `supabase-js` that acts as a **Bridge** between your app and the database (the backend). Without this toolbox, your app wouldn't know how to "talk" to the backend or show fancy animations!

3. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`).
4. Launch development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Launch Readiness

To ensure the project is ready for production, follow the Launch Checklist:

### 1. Verification Script
We have included a specialized script that automatically checks linting and build health. Run this before every deployment:
```powershell
./verify-launch.ps1
```

### 2. GitHub Synchronization
Ensure the latest stable version is on GitHub using the "Full Launch Fix" naming convention.

### 3. Environment Variables
Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correctly set in your production environment.
