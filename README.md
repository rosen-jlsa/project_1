# Salon Booking App (Project 1)

A professional, high-performance booking management system built for high-end hair salons.

## Project Overview

This application provides a seamless experience for clients to explore salon services, view transformations in a gallery, and book appointments with experts. It features a dual-mode data system (Supabase or Local JSON) for maximum reliability during development and production.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Booking Wizard**: Intelligent slot selection within business hours (10:00 - 18:00).
- **Interactive Gallery**: "Before & After" photo transformations.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure management of bookings and specialists.
- **Automated Workflow**: Email notifications and token-based booking approvals.

   ```bash
   cd project_1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`).
4. Launch development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Launch Readiness

To ensure the project is ready for production, follow the Launch Checklist:

### 1. Verification Script
We have included a specialized script that automatically checks linting and build health. Run this before every deployment:
```powershell
./verify-launch.ps1
```

### 2. GitHub Synchronization
Ensure the latest stable version is on GitHub using the "Full Launch Fix" naming convention.

### 3. Environment Variables

## FAQ

### 1. What is the purpose of the `node_modules` folder?
Think of the `node_modules` folder as a **Toolbox**. It contains all the pre-written packages, tools, and libraries that the application needs to function (like the Supabase client, React framework, etc.). You don't need to edit this folder; it is automatically managed by running `npm install`.

### 2. How do I connect the application to the backend?
The application is currently in **Mock Mode** because it doesn't have the necessary keys to talk to a real database. To connect to your Supabase backend:
1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and API keys.
